# WebDevCourse

About Repository : 

This repository is created to work on the WebDevCourse.
WE need to create two folders which is WebPart and MobilePart. 
Inside Webpart we create one folder for each ICP and then Inside each ICP we need to create two folders which are Source and Documention. 
In Source we need to add all the technical parts or the coding part and the Documentation folder should have the PDF file with the all the Screenshots and written explanations. 
README file contains all the information that we are using in the ICP and the process used in it.
